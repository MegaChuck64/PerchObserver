## Bird Identifier
### Like facial recognition for birds. 

1. Detect bird and crop frame using Object Detection model
2. Use feature extraction model to get arbritrary embeddings
  - Normalize embeddings
  - Compare to existing data
  - Find anomlies, similarities, etc.

The hard part about this project is verifying it's working. Luckily (for me), I had a Cardinal visitor who had an easily recognizable deformed beak. I named him Beaky.

Because of Beaky, I'm quite confident in this systems ability to decern northern cardinals from each other.
